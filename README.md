# My portfolio
This repo contains the source code for my web portfolio, this has been the third time I've re made it, but this time I focused on a more styled and playful way to display my projects, skills, experience and even the landing page with animations, night and light mode and the tsuchinoko from Bocchi the Rock as a mascot.
